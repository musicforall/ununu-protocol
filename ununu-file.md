#### Why ?

To track and store music metadata other than what is already stored automatically by git. Eg. BPM, No. of tracks, genre, etc.

#### How?

* A json file named 'ununu.json' is created on the initialization of the project in the root dir of the music project.
* Every time a new commit is added the new datapoints are appended to the file with timestamp.
